# 🎭 Deepfake Detection System

A Deep Learning-based web application that detects whether an uploaded image is **Real** or **Fake (Deepfake)** using a trained TensorFlow/Keras model.

Built using:
- Python
- Flask
- TensorFlow / Keras
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

---

# 🚀 Features

✅ Upload images for detection  
✅ Detects real vs fake faces  
✅ Deep learning model integration  
✅ Drag-and-drop upload UI  
✅ Confidence score prediction  
✅ Responsive modern frontend  
✅ Flask backend integration  

---

# 🧠 Model Information

The model was trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on a dataset containing:
- Real images
- AI-generated / manipulated fake images

The trained model:
```python
deepfake_model.h5
```

is loaded into the Flask application for prediction.

# ⚙️ Installation

## 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vibha13-12/deepfake-detection.git
```

---

## 2️⃣ Navigate to project folder

```bash
cd deepfake-detection
```

---

## 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a requirements file, install manually:

```bash
pip install flask tensorflow pillow numpy
```

---

# ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
python app/app.py
```

Then open:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

in your browser.

---

# 🖼️ How It Works

1. User uploads an image
2. Flask backend receives image
3. Image preprocessing is applied
4. TensorFlow model predicts:
   - REAL
   - FAKE
5. Result and confidence score are displayed on screen
